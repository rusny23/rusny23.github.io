# I'm Rusny Rahman.

I am a human and [programmer](https://github.com/rusny23). I like to read
books, listen to music, and take long walks around NYC. I am interested in 
application developement, webdev, and embedded software.

You can [email me](mailto:rusnyrahman@gmail.com) if you so desire. I'm
happy to talk about anything.
