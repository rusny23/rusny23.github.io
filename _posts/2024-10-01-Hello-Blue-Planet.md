Hello! Welcome to my first blog post. I thought it'd be a good time to start now
and write down my thoughts in a more composed manner. I'm attempting to make 
this a habit and will try my best to make a new post at least twice a month.
<br>

I was first inspired to make a blog after visiting Max Bernstein's blog. 
I took a mini online ex-college class he taught with another Tufts Alummnus on 
career prep specifically for software engineering. His blog looked extremely 
clean and simple and was an overall joy to read. I've always wanted to create my
own website to display my work and I think a blog is a neat way to do just that! 
<br>

I hope to make technical posts that focus on my experience working with
new technologies and describe the challenges I've faced in projects. Sometimes
posts will deviate from the norm and be focused on life updates/philosophical 
thoughts. These sorts of posts are more for my own personal growth and to help 
put up a fight in my never-ending battle with the English language. When I get 
nervous, my sentences and confidence flee from my grasp and I'm left filling the
void with 'um's and 'like's. Hopefully taking the time to think about my words 
and editing my long-winded thought process 
can help me tackle these issues.

### Moving On

I recently graduated from Tufts University this past May and am on the hunt for entry-level SWE/SWE adjacent jobs. The whole process has been extremely grueling but 
has pushed me to adapt to new changes. It's scary not knowing where my career is 
heading but I know I will excel wherever I am. 

Everything feels so uncertain at the moment but I am grateful for the good in my
life. I think I've reached the point in life where time seems to be moving so 
fast no matter how much you try to stuff in a day. I'm getting used to the hours
and the minutes that pass. Instead of rushing to make memories, I'm learning to 
live and let live.
