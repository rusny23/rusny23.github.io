Hello! Welcome to my first blog post. I thought it'd be a good time to start now
and write down thoughts in a more composed manner. I'm attempting to make this a
habit and will try my best to make a new post at least twice a month.

I was first inspired to make a blog after seeing the blog of a Tufts alummnus
named Max Bernstein. I took a mini online ex-college class he taught with 
another Tufts Alummnus on career prep specifically for software engineering. 
His blog looked extremely clean and simple and was an overall joy to read. I've 
always wanted to create my own website to display my work and I think a blog is 
a neat way to do just that! 

I hope to make technical posts that focus on my experience working with
new technologies and describing the challenges I've faced in projects. Sometimes
posts will deviate from the norm and be focused on life updates/philisophical 
thoughts. These sorts of posts are more for my own personal growth in my 
never-ending battle with the intricacies of the English langauge and syntax. When
I get nervous, my sentences and confidence flee from my grasp and I'm left filling
the void with 'um's and 'like's. 

### Moving On

I recently graduated Tufts this past May and am on the hunt for entry level 
SWE/SWE adjacent jobs. The whole process has been extremely grueling and has 
left me feeling a bit dejected. Its as if I've completed 50% of a life-long
marathon with grit and perseverence but now I've slammed face first into 
a wall that bars me from life beyond.  

Life feels scary at the moment but I am grateful for the good in my life. My
mind has been drifting to the past more often these days. I think I've reached
the point in life where time seems to be moving so fast no matter how much you
try to stuff in a day. I'm getting used to the hours in a day.
